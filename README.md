# My NLP Learning Journal

Welcome to my NLP Learning Journal! This repository documents my exploration and implementation of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Each task is organized into a dedicated folder, containing Jupyter Notebooks and detailed README files explaining the methods and approaches used.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. IMDB Sentiment Analysis with N-gram Models

Explore sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using N-gram models. The notebook includes implementations and discussions around different N-gram models for sentiment classification.

### 2. POS Tagging with Viterbi Algorithm and HMM

Dive into Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using the Viterbi algorithm and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The notebook provides insights into how these algorithms can be applied for POS tagging in text.

### 3. Information Retrieval System with TF-IDF and LSI

Build an Information Retrieval System using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Understand the basics of document similarity and relevance ranking.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis with Transformer and BERT Models

Implement sentiment analysis using state-of-the-art Transformer and BERT models. The notebook walks through the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification.

### 5. NER and POS with BERT

Address Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tasks using BERT-based models. Learn about tokenization, alignment, and multitasking with BERT for these NLP tasks.
